Here’s a sample README.md file for setting up a Chrome Extension with Vite and React:

# Vite React Chrome Extension Template

This repository is a starter template for creating a Chrome Extension using **Vite** and **React**. It is lightweight, fast, and supports modern development workflows.

## Features

- 🚀 **Vite**: Lightning-fast build tool with HMR (Hot Module Replacement).
- ⚛️ **React**: Build dynamic user interfaces with React.
- 🛠️ **Manifest V3**: Chrome Extension Manifest v3 setup.
- 📦 **Production-Ready**: Optimized for efficient packaging.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or later)
- npm or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/vite-react-chrome-extension.git
cd vite-react-chrome-extension

2. Install Dependencies

npm install
# or
yarn install

3. Development Mode

Start the development server:

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

The development server runs with HMR and serves the extension's assets.

4. Build for Production

Generate production-ready files:

npm run build
# or
yarn build

The output will be in the dist folder.

Customize Manifest

Edit the manifest.json file in the src directory to suit your extension's needs.

Example Manifest Snippet:

{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "Vite React Chrome Extension",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "permissions": ["storage"],
  "action": {
    "default_popup": "index.html"
  },
  "background": {
    "service_worker": "background.js"
  },
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": ["<all_urls>"],
      "js": ["content.js"]
    }
  ]
}

Development Notes

Hot Reloading: Vite enables hot reloading during development for React components.

Manifest Updates: Make sure to rebuild after updating manifest.json or background scripts.

Testing: Use the Chrome DevTools extension environment to debug.
